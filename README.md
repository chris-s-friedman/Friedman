# Friedman
This repo holds all of my personal R functions that I re-use and have found helpful to throw together into a package. Who knows... maybe someone will find these helpful someday!

Just a note: I'm working less in R than I used to, so may be slow to update this package, but if there is anything you wish there were, feel free to fork, make some changes, and file a PR! :smile:

## Installation
Using the devtools package, execute: `devtools::install_github("chris-s-friedman/Friedman")`
